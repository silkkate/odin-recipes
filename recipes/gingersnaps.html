    <h2 class="gingersnap">Description</h2>
    <p class="ginger-text">These are my personal favorite cookies in all of New York City. You can find them at the holiday markets at <strong>Bryant Park</strong> or <strong>Union Square</strong>, and outside of the holiday season, you can also purchase them at the <strong>farmers' market</strong> at Union Square on Wednesdays and Saturdays year-round.</p>
    <p class="ginger-text">These cookies are large, super soft and chewy, and have the perfect balance of ginger spice and sweet, smoky molasses. The sugar topping adds a <em>delicious</em> slight crunch. These cookies are sure to convert any ginger hater!</p>

    <h2 class="gingersnap">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp. cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup molasses &lpar;Grandma's is a good brand&rpar;</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar, plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="gingersnap">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cloves.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together oil, molasses, sugars, egg, and vanilla. Add dry ingredients to wet and mix until just combined. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° and line two baking sheets with parchment. Add sugar to a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a large cookie scoop (about 3 tablespoons), scoop chilled dough directly into sugar and roll to coat, then place on prepared baking sheet 3” apart. Dough will still be very soft and won't hold its shape completely. </li>
        <li>Bake until edges are barely set and tops are crinkled, but centers are still soft, 14 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
