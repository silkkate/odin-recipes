    <h2 class="bagel">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="bagel-text">
        <li>1 1/2 cup self rising flour &lpar;if using all-purpose flour, add 2 tsp. baking powder&rpar;</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup greek yogurt, plain &lpar;non-fat or regular will work&rpar;</li>
        <li>1 tsp. everything bagel seasoning, or seasoning of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="bagel">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="bagel-text">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375째F / 190째C.</li>
        <li>Combine Greek yogurt and self-raising flour in a mixing bowl. Knead with your hands, or with an electric mixer, until the dough sticks together. Be careful not to over mix the dough at this point, or it might become too sticky.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal sized pieces, and roll them into little balls. If the dough is quite wet, you might want to add some flour to your surface to prevent the dough from sticking to your surface.</li>
        <li>Push your thumbs through the middle of the dough balls to create a hole. Stretch this out to make a bagel shaped ring.</li>
        <li>Boil a pot of water and boil the bagles for 1-2 minutes on each side. Place the bagels on a sheet pan or baking sheet covered with parchment paper, and make sure to space them a little apart.</li>
        <li>Optionally, brush the bagels with egg wash, milk or water. This will give them a lovely golden shine, and helps the seasoning to stick to the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the seasoning on top of the bagels. You can omit this step if you prefer to make plain bagels.</li>
        <li>Bake the bagels for about 25 minutes. If they are looking a little pale, you can turn the temperature up to 425째F / 220째C, and bake for a few minutes until the bagels are golden brown.</li>
